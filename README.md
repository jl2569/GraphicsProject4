To call the makefile in this since I used windows I called mingw32-make and it will make the raycast.exe file
also compile the JSONparser.c file which holds all the code for parsing a JSON file setting object values and 
putting them into an image file.
For this file to work you would need a JSON file.
Do not need an output file, program will create one for you but in the arguments you do need to give it a name.
The image file will come out as a p3 image file.
After that is complete run "raycast.exe width height JSONfilename outputfilename" to run the program.
Done
